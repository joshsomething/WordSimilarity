Currently I'm on casual maintanance and configuration of this project, (do know I don't have the best experience with this sort of stuff).
As a student, I have to put priority on school over this repo, so don't expect quick or consistent responses.
If you're persistant enough, I should respond to Pull Requests, Issues and other collaborative work...
Do note when I say persistant, I don't mean being rude, or bugging me 24/7.
Be nice and constructive.
There's a big distinction!

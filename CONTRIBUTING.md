### For anyone who somehow stumbled on this project this quickly:
Do know that this is a science fair project, and right now the science fair is still ongoing.
It'll be about a week or so before it'll be completely finished. 
Just in case, I won't be accepting any Pull Requests untill about a week.
Afterwards, I will be on occasional, casual maintanance of this project, (do know I don't have the best experience with this sort of stuff).
If you're persistant enough (again, after a week or so), I may follow up on Pull Requests, Issues or other collaborative work...
well, when I feel like it :).
Do note when I say persistant, I don't mean being rude, or bugging me 24/7 on Github.
There's a big distinction!
